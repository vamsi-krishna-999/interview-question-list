Programming Task:
Design a simple class hierarchy to model different types of vehicles. Start with a base class Vehicle and then 
create subclasses for specific types of vehicles such as Car, Truck, and Motorcycle. Each subclass should 
inherit attributes and methods from the Vehicle class, and you should include additional attributes and 
methods specific to each subclass (e.g., num_wheels, fuel_type, drive() method). Implement method 
overriding as needed, and demonstrate the use of inheritance in creating and interacting with 
objects of different vehicle types.


Real world scenarios:

Employee Hierarchy:

Base Class: Employee
Subclasses: Manager, Developer, SalesPerson
Explanation: Each type of employee inherits common attributes and methods from the Employee 
class, such as name, id, and calculate_salary(). Subclasses like Manager, Developer, and 
SalesPerson can have additional attributes and methods specific to their roles.


Vehicle Types:

Base Class: Vehicle
Subclasses: Car, Truck, Motorcycle
Explanation: The Vehicle class contains common attributes and methods shared by all vehicles, 
such as make, model, and drive(). Each subclass like Car, Truck, and Motorcycle inherits 
these attributes and methods while adding specific features like num_doors, 
cargo_capacity, and start_engine().

Shape Hierarchy:

Base Class: Shape
Subclasses: Rectangle, Circle, Triangle
Explanation: The Shape class defines common properties and methods applicable 
to all shapes, such as area() and perimeter(). Subclasses like Rectangle, Circle, 
and Triangle inherit these methods while implementing their own algorithms for 
calculating area and perimeter specific to their shapes.


Bank Account Types:

Base Class: BankAccount
Subclasses: SavingsAccount, CheckingAccount, LoanAccount
Explanation: The BankAccount class defines common attributes and methods for managing bank accounts, 
such as account_number, balance, and deposit(). Subclasses like SavingsAccount, CheckingAccount, 
and LoanAccount inherit these properties while adding specific functionalities like interest 
calculation and overdraft protection.





Explanation of Single-Level Inheritance:
In single-level inheritance, there is a one-to-one relationship between a superclass and its subclass. The subclass inherits all the attributes and methods of the superclass, and it can optionally add its own attributes and methods. This allows for code reuse and promotes modularity and extensibility.

python
Copy code
class Animal:
    def sound(self):
        print("Animal makes a sound")

class Dog(Animal):  # Dog is a subclass inheriting from Animal superclass
    def bark(self):
        print("Dog barks")

# Creating an object of subclass Dog
dog = Dog()
dog.sound()  # Inherits sound() method from Animal
dog.bark()   # Method specific to Dog subclass
Important Concepts in Single-Level Inheritance:
Code Reusability: Single-level inheritance promotes code reuse by 
allowing subclasses to inherit attributes and methods from a superclass.

Polymorphism: Subclasses can override methods inherited from the 
superclass to provide their own implementation, enabling polymorphic behavior.

Abstraction: Superclasses often represent abstract concepts or general 
behaviors, while subclasses provide concrete implementations or specialize the behavior.

Encapsulation: Inheritance facilitates encapsulation by allowing related 
functionality to be grouped together in classes, promoting better organization and understanding of the code.

Complex Situations in Single-Level Inheritance:
Method Overriding: If a subclass overrides a method inherited from the superclass, 
ensuring that the overridden method behaves correctly and maintains compatibility
with the superclass can be complex.

Diamond Inheritance: While not specific to single-level inheritance, diamond 
inheritance occurs when a subclass inherits from two different subclasses that 
share a common superclass. This can lead to ambiguity and the "diamond problem" if not handled properly.

Initialization: Proper initialization of objects in the subclass, including 
calling the superclass's constructor (__init__ method) correctly, can be 
challenging, especially when dealing with multiple inheritance.

Dependency: Tight coupling between subclasses and superclasses can lead to
dependencies that make the code harder to maintain and extend. Careful design 
and adherence to principles like the Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) can mitigate this complexity.

Handling these complexities requires a good understanding of object-oriented
principles and careful design decisions to ensure a robust and maintainable codebase.




























Explanation of Multiple Inheritance:
In multiple inheritance, a subclass can inherit attributes and methods from multiple parent classes. This means that the subclass has access to the attributes and methods of all its parent classes, allowing for more diverse and complex class hierarchies.

python
Copy code
class A:
    def method_A(self):
        print("Method A from class A")

class B:
    def method_B(self):
        print("Method B from class B")

class C(A, B):  # Multiple inheritance: C inherits from both A and B
    def method_C(self):
        print("Method C from class C")

# Creating an object of subclass C
obj = C()
obj.method_A()  # Accessing method from class A
obj.method_B()  # Accessing method from class B
obj.method_C()  # Accessing method from class C
Important Concepts in Multiple Inheritance:
Code Reusability: Multiple inheritance allows for greater code reuse by inheriting a
ttributes and methods from multiple parent classes.

Mixin Classes: Mixin classes are a common use of multiple inheritance, 
where classes are designed to provide specific functionality that can be 
mixed in with other classes.

Method Resolution Order (MRO): In Python, the method resolution order determines 
the order in which methods are searched for and invoked in a class hierarchy. 
The mro() method can be used to determine the MRO for a class.

Diamond Inheritance Problem: Diamond inheritance occurs when a subclass inherits 
from two parent classes that have a common ancestor. This can lead to ambiguities 
and conflicts if not handled properly.

Complexities in Multiple Inheritance:
Diamond Inheritance Problem: Resolving conflicts and ambiguities arising from 
diamond inheritance can be complex. Python uses the C3 linearization algorithm 
to determine the method resolution order and resolve diamond inheritance issues.

Namespace Clashes: Inheriting from multiple parent classes can lead to namespace 
clashes if two parent classes define attributes or methods with the same name. 
This can be resolved by using aliases or by carefully designing the class hierarchy.

Method Overriding and Name Resolution: Multiple inheritance can make method 
overriding and name resolution more complex, as methods may be inherited from 
multiple parent classes, and the order of inheritance affects which method is invoked.

Initialization: Initializing objects in a class hierarchy with multiple inheritance 
can be challenging, especially if the parent classes have different initialization 
requirements or dependencies.

While multiple inheritance offers greater flexibility in designing class hierarchies, 
it also introduces complexity and potential pitfalls that must be carefully managed 
to ensure a robust and maintainable codebase.


Explanation of Multilevel Inheritance:
In multilevel inheritance, a class is derived from another class, which in turn is derived from another class, forming a hierarchy of classes. This allows for the creation of class hierarchies with multiple levels of abstraction and specialization.

python
Copy code
class A:
    def method_A(self):
        print("Method A from class A")

class B(A):  # B inherits from class A
    def method_B(self):
        print("Method B from class B")

class C(B):  # C inherits from class B, which in turn inherits from class A
    def method_C(self):
        print("Method C from class C")

# Creating an object of subclass C
obj = C()
obj.method_A()  # Accessing method from class A
obj.method_B()  # Accessing method from class B
obj.method_C()  # Accessing method from class C
Important Concepts in Multilevel Inheritance:
Code Reusability: Multilevel inheritance allows for code reuse by 
inheriting properties and behaviors from multiple ancestor classes.

Abstraction: Each level in the class hierarchy can represent a 
different level of abstraction, with more specialized functionality as you move down the hierarchy.

Method Overriding: Subclasses can override methods inherited from 
their ancestor classes to provide specialized implementations.

Method Resolution Order (MRO): Python uses the C3 linearization 
algorithm to determine the method resolution order in multilevel 
inheritance, ensuring consistent and predictable behavior.

Complexities in Multilevel Inheritance:
Initialization: Proper initialization of objects in a multilevel 
inheritance hierarchy, including calling constructors of ancestor 
classes, can be challenging, especially when dealing with multiple levels of abstraction.

Dependency Management: Tight coupling between classes in a multilevel 
inheritance hierarchy can lead to dependencies that make the code harder 
to maintain and extend. Careful design and adherence to principles like 
the Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) can mitigate this complexity.

Method Overriding Conflicts: When a method is overridden in multiple 
ancestor classes, resolving conflicts and ensuring the correct method is invoked can be complex.

Namespace Clashes: Inheriting from multiple ancestor classes can lead 
to namespace clashes if two classes define attributes or methods with 
the same name. This can be resolved by using aliases or by carefully designing the class hierarchy.

While multilevel inheritance offers flexibility in designing class 
hierarchies with multiple levels of abstraction, it also introduces 
complexity that must be carefully managed to ensure a maintainable and robust codebase.















Single Inheritance: Each class can have at most one direct parent class. Therefore, 
the total count of single inheritances is equal to the number of classes that have a single parent.

Multiple Inheritance: In multiple inheritance, a class can inherit from multiple parent classes. 
The count of multiple inheritances is determined by the number of classes that have more than one parent.

Multilevel Inheritance: In multilevel inheritance, a class is derived from another derived class, 
forming a chain of inheritance. The count of multilevel inheritances depends on the depth of the 
inheritance hierarchy and the number of levels of derivation.

Hierarchical Inheritance: Hierarchical inheritance occurs when more than one class inherits from 
the same base class. The count of hierarchical inheritances is equal to the number of classes that share a common base class.

Hybrid (or Mixin) Inheritance: Hybrid inheritance combines multiple types of inheritance, such as
single, multiple, or multilevel inheritance, within the same class hierarchy. 
The count of hybrid inheritances is determined by the combination of different 
inheritance types used in the codebase.
